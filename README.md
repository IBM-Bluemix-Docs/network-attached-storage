# network-attached-storage

NAS stands for Network Attached Storage and is our storage option for users looking for a solution similar to our complimentary LockBox storage but with more space. NAS allows for remote file storage directly from the server using either command line/terminal interactions or through point-and-click interactions, if available. In addition to direct interaction with NAS from your server, you may also use either Parallels Plesk Panel or cPanel&WHM with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files to NAS. FTP is complimentary with any NAS service, and NAS is offered at a nominal monthly fee based on the amount of storage you wish to purchase.

This collection belongs to the Storage tribe. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this offering, please contact Amy Blea, Offering Manager (amyn@us.ibm.com) or Viktoria Muirhead, Information Developer (viktoria.muirhead@ibm.com).
