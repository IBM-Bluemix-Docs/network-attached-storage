# Getting Started with NAS

NAS stands for Network Attached Storage and is our legacy storage option for users looking for a solution similar to our complimentary LockBox storage but with more space.  NAS allows for remote file storage directly from the server using either command line/terminal interactions or through point-and-click interactions, if available.  In addition to direct interaction with NAS from your server, you may also use either Parallels Plesk Panel or cPanel&WHM with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files to NAS.  FTP is complimentary with any NAS service, and NAS is offered at a nominal monthly fee based on the amount of storage you wish to purchase.

Please refer to our current [Cloud Storage Solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/cloud-storage){:new_window} to select an offering that meets your needs.

## Changing the Password for a NAS Storage Service

Each NAS Storage service has an associated password used to access the NAS service in the command line of your selected operating systems.  
For many of our {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} products and services, the password storage feature within the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} is used solely for storage or tracking of the password and changes made to the password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} are not applied to the product or service. This is not the case for the NAS service. 

Changes made to the NAS password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} will be made to the service itself.  Please make changes while keeping in mind that they will impact your service directly. 

Follow the steps below to change a NAS password in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.
