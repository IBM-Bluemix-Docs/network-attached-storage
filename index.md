# Getting Started with NAS

NAS stands for Network Attached Storage and is our legacy storage option for users looking for a solution similar to our complimentary LockBox storage but with more space.  NAS allows for remote file storage directly from the server using either command line/terminal interactions or through point-and-click interactions, if available.  In addition to direct interaction with NAS from your server, you may also use either Parallels Plesk Panel or cPanel&WHM with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files to NAS.  FTP is complimentary with any NAS service, and NAS is offered at a nominal monthly fee based on the amount of storage you wish to purchase.

IBM Cloud is ending the sales (EOS) of NAS FTP storage services across all sales channels on **March 31, 2018**.

How will EOS impact you?

- New customers will not be able to buy NAS FTP storage after **March 31, 2018**.
- Existing customers will be able to use already provisioned NAS FTP storage after **March 31, 2018**, but will not be able to provision additional NAS FTP storage.

We recommend you explore our [IBM Cloud storage solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/storage) such as Block or File storage with tiered and custom performance options up to 48,000 IOPS and capacity up to 12TB - no matter your workloads, we have an easily customizable and cost-effective storage environment for you.

For more information or questions, please contact sales or support. <br />

For many of our {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} products and services, the password storage feature within the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} is used solely for storage or tracking of the password and changes made to the password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} are not applied to the product or service.
