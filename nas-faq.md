# Network Attached Storage - Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I Use NAS to Store Files from My Personal Devices?

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} only allows files from devices on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} network to be stored with NAS, meaning that files on personal devices are not eligible for NAS. However, any file from a device on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} network may be stored with NAS.

## Why Can't I Connect My Device and Store My Files on NAS within the Customer Portal?

Mounting or connecting NAS and configuring FTP connections varies based on the operating system or control panel you are using.  Within each individual system or panel, configuration options are unique.  Some systems offer a robust set of options to customize your remote storage, while some systems allow for more basic storage configurations.  Because of this, working directly in your system will provide the best result from an end-user perspective.
